###Application
- A retailer can incorporate with their shopping cart. In a scenario where a customer wants to reach a minimum purchase total to qualify for free shipping, the customer can choose to fund another user's wish list item to count towards their purchase total.

- A retailer can add this feature to a gift register where contributors can fund items. The benefit would be the purchase of a more significant item for the recipient. An issue would be if the item does not get fully funded. An option would be for the contributor to provide a fall back item or the recipient can choose to fund the remainder of the item.

###Stack (technologies)
- Active Record (ORM)
- Embedded Ruby (ERB)
